# YourTube
Reinventing the YouTube algorithm by giving power back to the user.

## Demo Video
A video demonstrating the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/8kc_7zRzXDk).

## About
This application was created by a three-person team of students at the University of Florida for the course Data Structures and Algorithms. The main purpose of this project is to compare breadth-first and depth-first graph traversal algorithms.

## How it Works
YourTube is a full-stack application using C++ and the Qt GUI library to implement an interactive interace with a powerful backend. 
The user is prompted to select filters that will be applied to a YouTube dataset, allowing the graphing algorithms to intelligently select videos to the users liking.

## Why this Project Matters
A customizable algorithm allows the user to see videos that truly interest them, without the intrusive clutter that YouTube currently reccommends.
